  <h1>Predicting Exercise Manner using Accelerometer Data</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>In this project, we predict the manner in which exercises were performed using accelerometer data from wearable devices like Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit...</p>

  <h2>Data Preprocessing</h2>
  <p>The dataset was loaded and cleaned by removing irrelevant columns and handling missing values...</p>

  <h2>Model Building</h2>
  <p>A Random Forest model was trained to predict the exercise manner...</p>

  <h2>Model Evaluation</h2>
  <p>The model's accuracy was evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation...</p>

  <h2>Predictions on Test Data</h2>
  <p>We made predictions for the test data and saved them in the required format...</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The Random Forest model was able to predict the exercise manner with high accuracy...</p>
